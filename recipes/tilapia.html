            <li>Salt and Ground Black Pepper: to taste</li>
            <li>All-Purpose Flour: 1/2 cup</li>
            <li>Olive Oil: 1 tbsp</li>
            <li>Unsalted Butter: 2 tbsp, melted</li>
            <li>Lemon Juice: 1 tbsp</li>
            <li>Chopped Parsley: 1 tsp</li>

    <p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse tilapia fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Season both sides of each fillet
                with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place flour in a shallow dish. Gently press each fillet into the flour to coat and shake off any
                excess.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tilapia fillets in the hot oil, in
                batches if necessary, until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Brush melted butter onto the tilapia fillets in the last minute before removing from the skillet.</li>
            <li>Drizzle fillets with lemon juice and garnish with parsley and thyme.</li>
        </ol>
